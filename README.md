# Tapped_Delay_Line

the sole objective of this project is to create a Tapped_Delay_Line model  in which number of the taps, delay between each taps(ns), carrier frequency, and the Max speed are variables.  at the end we created a GUI for better observation.

first we have to calculate doppler frequency:
